Environment:
    OS  Debian
    gcc 4.8.3
    GNU make 4.0

Language:
    Python
    Matlab

Package:
    NLTK
    gensim

Directory tree and file list:
    because the path is hard coded in makefile and some python codes, 
    you have to make sure the directory tree is the same to guarantee 
    proper program behavior. 
    
    /                       : root folder of all programs and data
    /Readme                 : this file
    /Report.pdf             : HW3 report
    /Holmes_Training_Data/  : training data
    /testing_data.txt       : testing data
    /src/                   : all source code

    /feature_1_100_2/       : feature generated after preprocessing
    /feature_1_100_2/N      : 1-of-N feature
    /feature_1_100_2/Vec    : word2vec feature

Usage:
    if NLTK package is not installed:
        $ pip install nltk
        $ python -m nltk.downloader all

    if gensim is not installed:
        $ pip install gensim

    $ python ./src/preprocess.py -f ./

    After preprocessing, edit main_rnn.m to setup your parameters, input 
    file folder and etc. Then start matlab and run:
    
    >> main_rnn

    This will do both training and testing. 
    For fRNN, do the similar things as RNN and use main_frnn.m instead.
